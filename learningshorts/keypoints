node files created using .js extention

-->Main Point 
    Run node File in cmd Go to the folder use node filename.js

we have almost same functionality for loops and array and data in node as js 

-->include files and modules
    we have to use require for that and pass file path or module name like if we have file name app than pass ./app or we want to add fs module or http module than pass fs or http

--> create server using http module
    http.createServer and req response
    run on port using listen

-->package.json file and create and manage
    package.json we don't have to create but we have to run command "npm init" command and it will generate package.json file

-->Install packages using npm 
    Example::npm i colors
             npm i simple-node-logger

-->Nodemon package
    We have to run our project every time when we made changes in it to avoiding that we are using nodemon nodemon will run our files autometically.

--> Node js is async language it is not wait for anycommand to run and than nex command will run. instead of these it will run next command and do not wait for previous like if 2nd command taking to much time than it will run 3rd command and will show result of second command after finish it running.

-->Process.argv taking input from cmd and show and use it.
