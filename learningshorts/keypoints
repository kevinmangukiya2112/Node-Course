node files created using .js extention

-->Main Point 
    Run node File in cmd Go to the folder use node filename.js

we have almost same functionality for loops and array and data in node as js 

-->include files and modules
    we have to use require for that and pass file path or module name like if we have file name app than pass ./app or we want to add fs module or http module than pass fs or http

--> create server using http module
    http.createServer and req response
    run on port using listen

-->package.json file and create and manage
    package.json we don't have to create but we have to run command "npm init" command and it will generate package.json file

-->Install packages using npm 
    Example::npm i colors
             npm i simple-node-logger
